AI-powered system for predicting and detecting marine waste using drones and environmental data
# 🌊 OceanGuard AI - Marine Waste Prediction & Detection

## 🚀 Overview
OceanGuard AI is an innovative system that uses **AI and drones** to **predict and detect marine waste** in real-time. Our solution empowers environmental agencies, researchers, and coastal communities to take **preventive action** before waste accumulates, helping preserve marine ecosystems.

## 🎯 Main Purpose
To **predict future marine waste accumulation zones** by analyzing environmental factors such as:
- Wind direction & speed
- Ocean currents
- Historical drone imagery

This allows proactive cleanup and efficient resource deployment before pollution becomes widespread.

## 🔍 Key Features
- 🔹 Drone-based image collection over coastal and ocean areas
- 🔹 AI-powered waste detection from drone footage (plastic, fishing nets, etc.)
- 🔹 Predictive modeling using environmental data (wind, current)
- 🔹 Visual dashboard showing waste heatmaps and predicted zones
- 🔹 Real-time alerts to local authorities for rapid response

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js (planned dashboard for visualization)
- **Backend**: Python (Flask or Django)
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow / OpenCV for image classification
- **Geospatial Data**: Wind & ocean current data APIs (e.g., NOAA, Copernicus)
- **Cloud**: AWS or Render for hosting; Google Earth Engine for environmental overlays

## 🧠 How It Works
1. **Drone flies** over the ocean and captures imagery
2. **AI model analyzes** imagery to detect waste (plastic, nets, etc.)
3. **Environmental data** (wind, currents) is integrated
4. **Predictive model** forecasts where waste will drift or accumulate
5. **Interactive dashboard** displays real-time and forecasted waste locations

## 📊 Future Plans
- ✅ Build MVP with waste detection module
- ✅ Train prediction model on real-time wind/ocean datasets
- ⏳ Integrate dashboard UI for live results
- ⏳ Partner with coastal NGOs for field testing

## 🖼️ Preview & Media
